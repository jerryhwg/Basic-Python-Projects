'''
Generators allow us to generate as we go along, instead of holding everything in memory.
Generators are best for calculating large sets of results 
(particularly in calculations that involve loops themselves) 
in cases where we donâ€™t want to allocate the memory 
for all of the results at the same time.

        a,b = b,a+b
